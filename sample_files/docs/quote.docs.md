## Quotes are cool!

Check out the [possible colors](/sg/colors).

This is how you can include a quote.

```
{% include 'quote.twig' with {
  "quotation": "When everybody loves you, son, that's just about as funky as you can be",
  "attribution": {
    "name": "Mr Jones",
    "title": "Someone just a little more funky"
  }
} only %}
```
